# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is `worker-tetra`, a RunPod Serverless worker template that provides dynamic GPU provisioning for ML workloads with transparent execution and persistent workspace management. The project consists of two main components:

1. **RunPod Worker Handler** (`src/handler.py`) - A serverless function that executes remote Python functions with dependency management and workspace support
2. **Tetra SDK** (`tetra-rp/` submodule) - Python library for distributed inference and serving of ML models

## Key Areas of Responsibility

### 1. Remote Function Execution Engine (`src/`)
- **Core Handler** (`src/handler.py:18`): Main RunPod serverless entry point that orchestrates remote execution
- **Remote Executor** (`src/remote_executor.py:11`): Central orchestrator that coordinates all execution components using composition pattern
- **Function Executor** (`src/function_executor.py:12`): Handles individual function execution with full output capture (stdout, stderr, logs)
- **Class Executor** (`src/class_executor.py:14`): Manages class instantiation and method execution with instance persistence and metadata tracking

### 2. HuggingFace Model Cache-Ahead (`src/huggingface_cache.py`)
- **Model Pre-Caching**: Downloads HuggingFace models before user code execution
- **Cache Validation**: Checks if models are already cached to avoid redundant downloads
- **Authentication**: Supports HF_TOKEN for private/gated model access
- **Transfer Acceleration**: Uses hf_transfer when HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 is set
- **Transparent Caching**: User code references models without knowing they're pre-cached

### 3. Dependency Management System (`src/dependency_installer.py:14`)
- **Python Package Installation**: UV-based package management with environment-aware configuration (Docker vs local)
- **System Package Installation**: APT/Nala-based system dependency handling with acceleration support
- **Differential Installation**: Optimized package installation that skips already-installed packages
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic Docker vs local environment detection for appropriate installation methods
- **System Package Filtering**: Intelligent detection of system-available packages to avoid redundant installation
- **Universal Subprocess Integration**: All subprocess operations use centralized logging utility

### 4. Universal Subprocess Utility (`src/subprocess_utils.py`)
- **Centralized Subprocess Operations**: All subprocess calls use `run_logged_subprocess` for consistency
- **Automatic Logging Integration**: All subprocess output flows through log streamer at DEBUG level
- **Environment-Aware Execution**: Handles Docker vs local environment differences automatically
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent FunctionResponse pattern for all subprocess operations
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts with proper cleanup on timeout/cancellation

### 5. Serialization & Protocol Management
- **Protocol Definitions** (`src/remote_execution.py:13`): Pydantic models for request/response with validation
- **Serialization Utils** (`src/serialization_utils.py`): CloudPickle-based data serialization for function arguments and results
- **Base Executor** (`src/base_executor.py`): Common execution interface and environment setup

### 6. Tetra SDK Integration (`tetra-rp/` submodule)
- **Client Interface**: `@remote` decorator for marking functions for remote execution
- **Resource Management**: GPU/CPU configuration and provisioning through LiveServerless objects
- **Live Serverless**: Dynamic infrastructure provisioning with auto-scaling
- **Protocol Buffers**: Communication protocol definitions for distributed execution

### 7. Testing Infrastructure (`tests/`)
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Component-level testing for individual modules with mocking
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): End-to-end workflow testing with real execution
- **Test Fixtures** (`tests/conftest.py:1`): Shared test data, mock objects, and utility functions
- **Handler Testing**: Local execution validation with JSON test files (`src/tests/`)
  - **Full Coverage**: All handler tests pass with environment-aware dependency installation
  - **Cross-Platform**: Works correctly in both Docker containers and local macOS/Linux environments

### 8. Build & Deployment Pipeline
- **Docker Containerization**: GPU (`Dockerfile`) and CPU (`Dockerfile-cpu`) image builds
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and releases (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Quality Gates** (`Makefile:104`): Format checking, type checking, test coverage requirements
- **Release Management**: Automated semantic versioning and Docker Hub deployment

### 9. Configuration & Constants
- **Constants** (`src/constants.py`): System-wide configuration values (NAMESPACE, LARGE_SYSTEM_PACKAGES)
- **Environment Configuration**: RunPod API integration and HuggingFace cache settings

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`src/handler.py`**: Main RunPod serverless handler implementing composition pattern
  - Executes arbitrary Python functions remotely with workspace support
  - Handles dynamic installation of Python and system dependencies with differential updates
  - Serializes/deserializes function arguments and results using cloudpickle
  - Captures stdout, stderr, and logs from remote execution

- **`src/remote_execution.py`**: Protocol definitions using Pydantic models
  - `FunctionRequest`: Defines function execution requests with dependencies
  - `FunctionResponse`: Standardized response format with success/error handling

- **`tetra-rp/`**: Git submodule containing the Tetra SDK
  - `client.py`: `@remote` decorator for marking functions for remote execution
  - `core/resources/`: Resource management for serverless endpoints
  - Auto-provisions RunPod Serverless infrastructure

### Key Patterns

1. **Remote Function Execution**: Functions decorated with `@remote` are automatically executed on RunPod GPU workers
2. **Composition Pattern**: RemoteExecutor uses specialized components (DependencyInstaller, HuggingFaceCacheAhead, Executors)
3. **Dynamic Dependency Management**: Dependencies specified in decorators are installed at runtime with differential updates
4. **HuggingFace Cache-Ahead**: Models specified in `hf_models_to_cache` are pre-downloaded before execution
5. **Universal Subprocess Operations**: All subprocess calls use centralized `run_logged_subprocess` for consistent logging and error handling
6. **Environment-Aware Configuration**: Automatic Docker vs local environment detection for appropriate installation methods
7. **Serialization**: Uses cloudpickle + base64 encoding for function arguments and results
8. **Resource Configuration**: `LiveServerless` objects define GPU requirements, scaling, and worker configuration

## Development Commands

### Setup and Dependencies
```bash
make setup                    # Initialize project, sync dependencies, update submodules
make dev                      # Install all development dependencies (includes pytest, ruff)
uv sync                      # Sync production dependencies only
uv sync --all-groups         # Sync all dependency groups (same as make dev)
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make lint                     # Check code with ruff linter
make lint-fix                # Auto-fix linting issues
make format                   # Format code with ruff
make format-check            # Check if code is properly formatted
make quality-check           # Run all quality checks (format, lint, test coverage)
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
make test                     # Run all tests
make test-unit               # Run unit tests only
make test-integration        # Run integration tests only

make build-cpu               # Build CPU-only Docker image
# Note: Docker push is automated via GitHub Actions on release
```

### Submodule Management
```bash
git submodule update --remote --rebase    # Update tetra-rp to latest
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `RUNPOD_API_KEY`: Required for RunPod Serverless integration
- `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID`: Used for workspace isolation (automatically set by RunPod)
- `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER`: Set to "1" in Dockerfile to enable accelerated HuggingFace downloads
- `HF_TOKEN`: Optional authentication token for private/gated HuggingFace models
- `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`: Set during system package installation
- `UV_CACHE_DIR`: Package cache configuration
- `VIRTUAL_ENV`: Virtual environment path configuration

### Resource Configuration
Configure GPU resources using `LiveServerless` objects:
```python
gpu_config = LiveServerless(
    name="my-endpoint",           # Endpoint name (required)
    gpus=[GpuGroup.ANY],         # GPU types
    workersMax=5,                # Max concurrent workers
    workersMin=0,                # Min workers (0 = scale to zero)
    idleTimeout=5,               # Minutes before scaling down
    executionTimeoutMs=600000,   # Max execution time
)
```

## Testing and Quality

### Testing Framework
- **pytest** with coverage reporting and async support
- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test end-to-end workflows
- **Coverage target**: 35% minimum, with HTML and XML reports
- **Test fixtures**: Shared test data and mocks in `tests/conftest.py`
- **CI Integration**: Tests run on all PRs and before releases/deployments

## Development Notes

### Dependency Management
- Root project uses `uv` with `pyproject.toml`
- Tetra SDK has separate `pyproject.toml` in `tetra-rp/`
- System dependencies installed via `apt-get` in containerized environment
- Python dependencies installed via `uv pip install` at runtime
- **Differential Installation**: Only installs packages missing from environment
- **Environment Awareness**: Uses appropriate python preferences (Docker: `--python-preference=only-system`, Local: managed python)

### Error Handling
- All remote execution wrapped in try/catch with full traceback capture
- Structured error responses via `FunctionResponse.error`
- Combined stdout/stderr/log capture for debugging

### Security Considerations
- Functions execute arbitrary Python code in sandboxed containers
- System package installation requires root privileges in container
- No secrets should be committed to repository
- API keys passed via environment variables

## CI/CD and Release Process

### Automated Releases
- Uses `release-please` for automated semantic versioning and changelog generation
- Releases are triggered by conventional commit messages on `main` branch
- Docker images are automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub (`runpod/tetra-rp`) on release

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Single workflow handling tests, linting, releases, and Docker builds
  - Runs tests and linting on PRs and pushes to main
  - **Local execution testing**: Automatically tests all `test_*.json` files in src directory to validate handler functionality
  - Manages releases via `release-please` on main branch
  - Builds and pushes `:dev` tagged images on main branch pushes
  - Builds and pushes production images with semantic versioning on releases
- **Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Manual deployment workflow for custom Docker tags and emergency deployments

### Required Secrets
Configure these in GitHub repository settings:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub password or access token

## Branch Information
- Main branch: `main`
- Current branch: `deanq/ae-1165-bug-pytorchs-not-found`
- Submodule tracking: Updates pulled from remote automatically during setup

## Development Best Practices

- Always run `make quality-check` before committing changes
- Always use `git mv` when moving existing files around
- Run `make test-handler` to validate handler functionality with test files
- Never create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving goals
- Always prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- Never proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## Project Memories

### Docker Guidelines
- Docker container should never refer to src/

### Testing Guidelines
- Use `make test-handler` to run checks on test files
- Do not run individual test files manually like `Bash(env RUNPOD_TEST_INPUT="$(cat test_input.json)" PYTHONPATH=. uv run python handler.py)`

### File Management
- Use `git mv` when moving existing files
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create files when absolutely necessary
