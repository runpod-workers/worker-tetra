# Centralized Log Streaming System

## Overview

This design implements a comprehensive log streaming architecture that captures all system logs during remote execution and includes them in the `FunctionResponse.stdout` for complete visibility into dependency installation, workspace setup, and function execution.

## Key Components

### 1. LogStreamer (`src/log_streamer.py`)
Thread-safe log capture system that buffers logs and streams them to the response output.

```mermaid

    A[Remote Function Execution] --> B[LogStreamer]
    B --> C[Thread-Safe Buffer]
    C --> D[Log Formatting]
    D --> E[FunctionResponse.stdout]

    F[Dependency Installation] --> B
    G[Workspace Setup] --> B
    H[System Operations] --> B
```

### 2. Centralized Logging (`src/logger.py`)
Unified logging configuration with:
- **Debug Format**: `timestamp | level | name | file:line | message`
- **Production Format**: `timestamp | level | message`
- **Namespace**: All logs use `tetra.*` hierarchy

### 3. Integration Points

```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant RE as RemoteExecutor
    participant LS as LogStreamer
    participant DI as DependencyInstaller

    C->>RE: Execute Function
    RE->>LS: Start Log Streaming
    RE->>DI: Install Dependencies
    DI-->>LS: Log installation progress
    RE->>RE: Execute Function
    RE-->>LS: Capture execution logs
    LS->>RE: Streamed logs
    RE->>C: FunctionResponse with logs in stdout
```

## Technical Changes

### Log Namespace Consolidation
- Changed from `worker_tetra` to `tetra` namespace
- Consistent logging hierarchy across all components
- Better alignment with tetra-rp logging standards

### Memory Management
- Configurable buffer size (default: 1000 entries)
- Automatic buffer rotation prevents memory issues
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking

### Error Resilience
- Log streaming failures don't break execution
- Graceful fallback when streaming unavailable
- Robust error handling in all log operations

## Files Modified

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `src/log_streamer.py` | New centralized log streaming system |
| `src/logger.py` | New unified logging configuration |
| `src/remote_executor.py` | Integration with log streaming |
| `src/dependency_installer.py` | Log capture during installation |
| `src/test_log_streaming.json` | Test case for log visibility |

## Benefits

1. **Complete Observability**: All system operations visible in function response
2. **Debugging Efficiency**: Detailed logs help diagnose issues quickly
3. **Production Ready**: Clean, structured logs with appropriate formatting
4. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations don't interfere with log capture
5. **Memory Efficient**: Bounded buffer prevents memory exhaustion

## Testing

- New test case validates log capture and streaming
- Integration tests verify logs from dependency installation
- All existing tests pass with new logging system
- CI/CD maintains clean output with appropriate log levels
